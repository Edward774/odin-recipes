    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>½ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) package dry ranch salad dressing mix (such as Hidden Valley Ranch®)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup plain bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place butter in 9x13-inch baking dish and let melt in the preheating oven.</li>
        <li>Slice chicken breast against the grain into thin strips.</li>
        <li>Place ranch dressing mix in a small bowl. Whisk egg and milk together in a second bowl. Place bread crumbs in a third bowl.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken strip in ranch dressing mix, then coat in egg mixture and cover with bread crumbs; arrange in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Gently turn chicken pieces over and bake until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Allow to rest 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Note:</h2>
    <p>Baking time will vary depending on how thickly the chicken is sliced.</p>
